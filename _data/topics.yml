  title: Adaptive torque control
  description: Usually the control of robots rely on precise models, however, these can be unavailable or drift over time. Adaptive control techniques will be expected to correct for these modeling errors and compensate for them during the motion. The student will be working on our humanoid robots.

  title: Humanoid robots force control for multi-contact locomotion
  description: Locomotion control of legged robots requires force control that relies usually on contact force sensors, however humanoid or legged robot may use parts of their body that are not equipped with these sensors such as elbows and knees. In this work the student will develop and test a control of this kind of contact.

  title: Safe training of neural networks on real robotic platforms
  description: In most cases the training of neural networks to control the motion of humanoid and legged robots, happen in numerical simulation and then transferred to the real robot. In this work the student will design a framework to train neural networks directly on the real robot. They need to ensure the safety and the autonomy of the learning pipeline.

  title: Optimal structural design and structural force sensing for robot systems
  description: Force sensitivity is an important feature for robots that co-exist with humans. However, use of torque sensor was limited from increase in weight and size, and lowering of resonance frequency.  In this research, we study force sensing technique using structural materials and optimization of sensitivity and structural robustness.
